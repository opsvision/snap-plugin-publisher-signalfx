# Snap-Telemetry Plugin for SignalFx [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-signalfx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-signalfx) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-signalfx)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-signalfx)
Snap-Telemetry Plugin for SignalFx sends numeric values to [SignalFx](https://signalfx.com/).

## Getting Started
Read the system requirements, supported platforms, and installation guide for obtaining and using this Snap plugin.
### System Requirements 
* [golang 1.7+](https://golang.org/dl/) (needed only for building)

### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by snap:
* Linux/amd64
* Darwin/amd64

### Installation
The following sections provide a guide for obtaining the plugin.

#### Download
The simplest approach is to use ```go get``` to fetch and build the plugin. The following command will place the binary in your ```$GOPATH/bin``` folder where you can load it into snap.
```
$ go get github.com/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-signalfx
```

#### Building
The following provides instructions for building the plugin yourself if you decided to downlaod the source. We assume you already have a $GOPATH setup for [golang development](https://golang.org/doc/code.html). The repository utilizes [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) for library management.
```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/opsvision
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/opsvision
$ git clone http://github.com/opsvision/snap-plugin-publisher-signalfx
$ glide up

## Documentation

### Configuration and Usage
Set up the [Snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)

#### Load the Plugin
Once the framework is up and running, you can load the plugin.
```
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-publisher-signalfx
Plugin loaded
Name: signalfx
Version: 1
Type: publisher
Signed: false
Loaded Time: Tue, 24 Jan 2017 20:45:48 UTC
```

#### Task File
You need to create or update a task file to use the SignalFx publisher plugin. We have provided an example, _tasks/awssqs.yaml_ shown below. In our example, we utilize the psutil collector so we have some data to work with. There are three (3) configuration settings you can use.

Setting|Description|Required?|
|-------|-----------|---------|
|debug_file|An absolute path to a log file - this makes debugging easier.|No|
|hostname|The hostname to use; if absent, the plugin will attempt to determine the hostname.|No|
|token|The SignalFx [API token](https://developers.signalfx.com).|Yes|


```
---
  version: 1
  schedule:
    type: "simple"
    interval: "5s"
  max-failures: 10
  workflow:
    collect:
      config:
      metrics:
        /intel/psutil/load/load1: {} 
        /intel/psutil/load/load15: {}
        /intel/psutil/load/load5: {}
        /intel/psutil/vm/available: {}
        /intel/psutil/vm/free: {}
        /intel/psutil/vm/used: {}
      publish:
        - plugin_name: "signalfx"
          config:
            token: "1234ABCD"
            debug_file: "/tmp/signalfx-debug.log"
            hostname: "spiderman"
```

Once the task file has been created, you can create and watch the task.
```
$ snaptel task create -t signalfx.yaml
Using task manifest to create task
Task created
ID: 72869b36-def6-47c4-9db2-822f93bb9d1f
Name: Task-72869b36-def6-47c4-9db2-822f93bb9d1f
State: Running

$ snaptel task list
ID                                       NAME                                         STATE     ...
72869b36-def6-47c4-9db2-822f93bb9d1f     Task-72869b36-def6-47c4-9db2-822f93bb9d1f    Running   ...
```

_Note: Truncated results for brevity._

### Publisher Output
The SignalFx plugin **will only publish numeric values (int64 and float64)** using the SignalFx [Gauge and GaugeF](https://github.com/signalfx/golib/tree/master/sfxclient) respectively.  The code attempts to convert numeric values; e.g. uint --> int64.  All other metric values will be ignored (e.g. strings).  The metrics will be sent with the namespace, metric value (converted), and the hostname as a dimension. This makes it simple to identify and use the incoming values in SignalFx.

## Issues and Roadmap
* **Testing:** The testing being done is rudimentary at best. Need to improve the testing.

_Note: Please let me know if you find a bug or have feedbck on how to improve the collector._
